/**
 * Normalize the `path`, resolving `'..'` and `'.'` segments.
 * Note that resolving these segments does not necessarily mean that all will be eliminated.
 * A `'..'` at the top-level will be preserved, and an empty path is canonically `'.'`.
 *
 * @experimental **UNSTABLE**: New API, yet to be vetted.
 *
 * @example Usage
 * ```ts
 * import { normalize } from "@hyprx/path/windows/unstable-normalize";
 * import { equal } from "@hyprx/assert";
 *
 * equal(normalize("C:\\foo\\..\\bar"), "C:\\bar");
 * equal(normalize(new URL("file:///C:/foo/../bar")), "C:\\bar");
 * ```
 *
 * @param path The path to normalize. Path can be a string or a file URL object.
 * @returns The normalized path
